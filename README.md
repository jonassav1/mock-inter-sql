Mock Interview SQL

This project is designed to mock interviews. We use sqlite3 and node.js work with database. This is two part project on one part we are employer and we as questions and test knowledge of the interviewee, on the other part we are the interviewee and employer test our knowledge.

Features of this project:
Database- sqlite3 movie database for efficient data management.
Node.js- for handing backend javascript queries.
Self prepared questions- questions are prepared for the employer part of the project!
Take home questions- are solved for the inerviewee part of this project.

Improvements:
It would be cool to create a website that would allow to select a role employer or interviewee and then depending on that either you would have to answer questions or create them. Also I would like to add more visualization for the database.
